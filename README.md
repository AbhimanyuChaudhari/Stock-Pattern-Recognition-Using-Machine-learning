## Stock Pattern Recognition

This project includes a module for recognizing various stock patterns, which are crucial for technical analysis and making informed trading decisions. The patterns recognized by our neural network models include:

### Recognized Patterns

1. **Head and Shoulder (HS)**
   - A reversal pattern that indicates a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. It is characterized by two smaller peaks (shoulders) on either side of a larger peak (head).

2. **Inverse Head and Shoulder (IHS)**
   - The opposite of the Head and Shoulders pattern. It indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal and consists of a large trough between two smaller troughs.

3. **Broadening Top (BTOP)**
   - A pattern that signifies increased volatility with higher highs and lower lows, typically indicating a market top.

4. **Broadening Bottom (BBOT)**
   - Similar to the Broadening Top but indicates a market bottom, characterized by expanding price action with lower lows and higher highs.

5. **Triangle Top (TTOP)**
   - A bearish continuation pattern that forms during an uptrend and signals a potential reversal or continuation of the trend, characterized by converging trendlines.

6. **Triangle Bottom (TBOT)**
   - A bullish continuation pattern that forms during a downtrend, indicating a potential reversal or continuation of the trend, with converging trendlines pointing downward.

7. **Rectangle Top (RTOP)**
   - A bearish continuation pattern that forms during an uptrend, where the price moves within a rectangle indicating consolidation before a potential trend reversal.

8. **Rectangle Bottom (RBOT)**
   - A bullish continuation pattern that forms during a downtrend, where the price consolidates within a rectangle before potentially reversing the trend.

### How It Works

1. **Data Collection**
   - Historical stock price data is collected and preprocessed to highlight significant patterns and trends.

2. **Pattern Recognition Models**
   - Various neural network models are trained to recognize and predict these patterns. The models take input as time-series data and output the identified pattern.

3. **Model Training**
   - Models are trained on labeled datasets containing historical instances of these patterns. Advanced techniques like data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation are employed to improve accuracy.

4. **Evaluation**
   - The performance of the pattern recognition models is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Backtesting is performed to assess the practical applicability of the identified patterns.

### Example Usage

To use the pattern recognition module, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Data:**
   - Ensure your historical stock data is in the correct format and stored in the `data/` directory.

2. **Run Pattern Recognition:**
   - Use the pattern recognition script to analyze the data.
   ```sh
   python scripts/pattern_recognition.py --input data/your_stock_data.csv --output results/patterns_detected.csv
   ```

3. **Visualize Results:**
   - The results can be visualized using provided visualization tools.
   ```sh
   python scripts/visualize_patterns.py --input results/patterns_detected.csv --output figures/patterns_plot.png
   ```

### Future Work

- **Improvement of Pattern Detection Accuracy:**
  - Implementing more advanced neural network architectures and exploring ensemble methods.
- **Real-time Pattern Recognition:**
  - Developing a real-time detection system to provide trading signals on live data.
- **Integration with Trading Strategies:**
  - Combining pattern recognition with automated trading algorithms to create a full-fledged trading bot.
